# Digital Presence – 7-Day Trial & Challenge Tool

This project is a **single-page HTML tool** that manages a **7-day Digital Presence trial** for store owners.

It is designed for:
- **Promotors** – to prepare and configure store trials.
- **Store owners** – to activate their trial, share their QR/link, and see progress.
- **Admins** – to monitor share counts and decide discounts.

## ✨ Core Idea

1. **Promotor** sets up a store (name, phone, campaign goals).
2. **Owner** activates a **7-day trial** via OTP (demo).
3. The system tracks **shares** and **time remaining**.
4. At the end, the promotor uses the **share count + rules** to decide:
   - Discount level (30–60%)
   - Upgrades (pictures, promo section, spin-the-wheel, etc.)
5. Once the owner pays, a **new 1-year upgraded Digital Presence page** is created and the trial version is discarded.
